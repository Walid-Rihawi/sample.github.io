                <h2>button</h2>
                <p>Here is an example of the button tag. It is a little  bit misleading since it is a button that doesn't do anything. YOu would want to add some interactivity, perhaps with JAvaScript</p>
                <button>open</button><br><br>
                <button>close</button>

            <section>
                <h2>metter</h2>
                <p>The meter tag is cool and can take a lot of attributes. But again it is better if you have some code that can make the attribute values dynamic insted of "hardcoding" them, think of a final score for a test</p>
                <meter min="1" max="10" value="4"></meter><br>
                <meter min="1" max="10" value="5"></meter><br>
                <meter min="1" max="10" value="6"></meter>
                <hr>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>progress</h2>
                <p>THe progress tag has a very samilar layout to the meter tag. Yhe difference is that there is an assumption that there will be progression to where the value will equal 100. This tag is often used when filling out form that has many pages of questions.</p>
                <progress max="100" value="75"></progress>

                <h2>iframe</h2>
                <p>
                    The iframe is used to nest content. It is not supported equally by all browsers. You will want to explore settng many of the different options such as height and width.
